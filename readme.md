# Bifrost

Bifrost (/ˈbɪvrɒst/) is a tool for evaulation and optimization of DNN accelerators. The Bifrost interface bridges [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org) (a deep learning compiler) with [STONNE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07137.pdf) (a simulator for DNN accelerators). Bifrost let's you run DNN models on simulated reconfigurable DNN accelerators.

The name is taken from Norse mythology, where Bifrost is the bridge between Midgard and Asgard. 

# Quickstart Guide

## Installation
Bifrost is a Python tool. You can install it using pip:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/axelstjerngren/level-4-project#"egg=bifrost&subdirectory=bifrost"
```
This will enable to you to use the latest version of Bifrost.

**N.B You need to have Apache TVM installed. You can find installation instructions [here](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/install/index.html).**

## How to use

Bifrost extends TVM to support STONNE as an external library. Most of the workflow is identical to the usual TVM workflow, but with extra functinality defined to configure the simulated accelerator and its dataflow mapping.
All scripts which use must import TVM and Bifrost:
``` python
import tvm
import bifrost
```
Importing TVM and Bifrost in this order is essential. Bifrost overrides the LLVM operators and adds new external ones which calls the STONNE library. When importing bifrost a new directory called ```bifrost_temp``` is created in your current working directory. This directory stores the temporary files generated by Bifrost when running, the cycle output in cycles.json, and the detailed STONNE infromation if ```architecture.print_stats``` is enabled. This directory can be deleted afer use (and you've made sure to get the data you need).


### Running a DNN model

The simplest way to execute a DNN model is to use the built-in runners in Bifrost. Currently, PyTorch and ONNX models are supported.
``` python
 # Import the runner
from bifrost.runner.run import run_torch, run_onnx

# Get model and input
from alexnet import torch_model, input

# Run using Bifrost on STONNE. 
# If no architecture has been specified the default one will be used
output = run_torch(torch_model, input)
```

You can also run models from all deep learning librarues which are supported by TVM. Models from deep learning libraries other than PyTorch and ONNX can be used compiling them using TVM. [The TVM documentation contains gudies for PyTorch, Tensorflow, ONNX, MXNet, etc](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/index.html#compile-deep-learning-models) models, just replace the target string with ```target = "llvm -libs=stone"```. The following example shows how to run a PyTorch model without using the Bifrost runner:

```python
# Import tvm and bifrost
import tvm
import bifrost

# Get model and input
from alexnet import torch_model, input

# Trace torch model and load into tvm
torch_model.eval()
trace = torch.jit.trace(torch_model, input).eval()
mod, params = relay.frontend.from_pytorch(trace, [("trace", input.shape)])

# Use STONNE as an external library
target = "llvm -libs=stonne"

# Run the model
lib = relay.build(mod, target=target, params=params)
ctx = tvm.context(target, 0)
module = runtime.GraphModule(lib["default"](ctx))
module.set_input("trace", input)
output = module.run()
```
### Configuring the simulated architecture


|Option|Description|Restriction|
| --- | --- | --- |
|      |           |           |

``` python
# Import the architecture module 
from bifrost.stonne.simulator import architecture

# Configure the simulated architecture
architecture.ms_size = 128
architecture.rn_bw = 64
architecture.dn_bw = 64
architecture.controller_type = "SIGMA_SPARSE_GEMM"
architecture.sparsity_ratio = 0

# Create the config file which is used by STONNE
architecture.create_config_file()
```
If the architecture is not configured the following configuration is used:
|Option|Default|
| -- | -- |
|ms_size|16|
|reduce_network_type|ASNETWORK|
|ms_network_type|LINEAR|
|dn_bw|8|
|rn_bw|8|
|controller_type|MAERI_DENSE_WORKLOAD|
|accumulation_buffer_enabled|True|

By default STONNE will not create any output files during execution. This setting can be enabled by setting ```architecture.print_stats = True```





### Configure mapping
```
architecture.load_mapping(
  conv = [],
  fc =[],
)
```





### Tuning 
When tuning the mapping or the hardware for a DNN, we first need to set 
``` python
from bifrost.stonne.simulator import architecture

# Set the tuning to true
architecture.tune = True

```
You need to access the tuning module to create the tuning space
``` python
architecture.tuner
```

An example of tuning is availble in ```becnhmarks/alexnet/alexnet_tune.py```











# Advanced Instructions 
## Build from source

Install Apache TVM using the installation instructions [here](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/install/index.html).

Clone the project and cd into bifrost
```
git clone https://github.com/axelstjerngren/level-4-project
cd level-4-project/bifrost
```
You can now install it by running setup.py:
```
python setup.py install 
```
You can now use Bifrost.

Alternatively, if you are going to make modifications to Bifrost then export it to PYTHONPATH to tell python where to find the library. This way your changes will immeditaly be reflected and there is no need to call setup.py again.
```
export BIFROST=/path/to/level-4-project/bifrost/
export PYTHONPATH=$BIFROST/python:${PYTHONPATH}
```

## Modifying the C++ code 
All of the C++ files can be found in under:
```
level-4-project
|___bifrost
|    |__src
|    |   |__include
|    |   |     |__cost.h
|    |   |
|    |   |__conv_forward.cpp
|    |   |__cost.cpp
|    |   |__json.cpp
|    |   |__etc...
|    |__Makefile
```

Any new .cpp files will be automatically found by the Makefile as long as they are created within the /src folder. Before you compile the code you need STONNE, mRNA and TVM as enviroment variables (see next section) You can the compile your new code with the following commands:
```
cd bifrost
make -j
```

### C++ depdencies 
To change the C code you need to clone the STONNE, mRNA and TVM repositories:
```
git clone https://github.com/axelstjerngren/stonne
git clone https://github.com/axelstjerngren/mrna
git clone https://github.com/apache/tvm
```
Keeping these three in the same folder will be useful.
Before you can run **make** you need to export two environment variables:
```
export TVM_ROOT    = path_to_tvm/tvm
export STONNE_ROOT = path_to_stonne/stonne
export MRNA_ROOT   = path_to_stonne/stonne
```
The C++ should now compile correctly when you run **make** inside of the level-4-project/bifrost directory.

## Dependecies


Python >=3.8
* Apache TVM |  | 
* STONNE |A cycle-accurate simulator for reconfigurable DNN accelerators written in C++, a forked version is required for Bifrost| 
]* JSONCPP |A library to read/write JSON files for C++| https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp

STONNE
TVM
MRNA

**N.B** If you have TVM installed, you only need to run the pip command above. The C++ dependencies come pre-packaged together with Bifrost

## Run the tests
Bifrost includes a test suite to ensure the correctness of the supported operations. This will run all implemented layers (conv2d and dense) on STONNE and compare the output against the TVM LLVM implementation for correctness. The MAERI, SIGMA, and TPU architectures will be tested. You can run the tests using the following commands:
```
cd bifrost
python setup.py
```
Tested on macOS Big Sur (11.1) and Manjaro 20.2.1
